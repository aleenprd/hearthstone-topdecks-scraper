Although In the mage case this card will draw you the most value. In a spell hunter deck it will not synergize with the legendary bow since it will make it kinda useless. So good luck playing it there. But with proffesor putricide This card can give you tons of value. And cards like cloaked huntress will give you a unkillable turn 6 maybe 7.

Bad legendaries are fine, legendaries that are vanilla 5 mana 4/4s in 6 out of the 9 classes are NOT fine.

There‚Äôs even less point playing it in Wild as you‚Äôve got the real Mysterious Challenger. I guess there could be an edge case for a weird Odd/Secret Paladin hybrid (since all the aforementioned cards are even costed). Standard Secret Mage generally only runs 2 or 3 types of secret and Arcanologist has a better mana/stat line and curves nicely into a secret. This would be overkill in any Mage deck ‚Äì even in Wild where you might actually run 5 different types of secret. So‚Ä¶ that just leaves Hunter. Even then, this is a bit peculiar. You can‚Äôt use Even/Odd Hunters because the secrets cost 2 and this guy costs 5. You‚Äôre probably *not* going to want to add a 5 mana minion to Secret/Spell Hunter as it‚Äôs normally going to screw up ‚ÄúTo My Side‚Äù and ‚ÄúRhok‚Äôdelar‚Äù ‚Ä¶ that leaves a mid-range Beast Hunter with the Spellstone. To be fair, that‚Äôs not a bad deck but it doesn‚Äôt run that many secrets ‚Äì still, dropping a 4/4 minion that tutors 2 or 3 cards for 5 mana isn‚Äôt bad, especially since it‚Äôs got the Beast tag. ‚Ä¶ as for Rogue, well, there really isn‚Äôt a secret package worth running for this.', 'I hv preordered since karazhan but this time I m still not convinced that I should pay for this expansion. All the love to Druid is so discouraging.', 'if your preordering for one class then isnt it smart to wait until all the cards are revealed to see if the class looks good?', 'I also forgot a huge downside. It‚Äôs 5 DIFFERENT secrets not any 5 secrets. So you can‚Äôt even draw secrets you run 2 of.', 'The only classes that run secrets are Mage and Hunter, the only time you‚Äôd use a secret in Rogue deck is a OTK Rogue.

Mage: Many secrets to use, pretty good, but clogs up hand with five 3 mana spells. Maybe too slow. BUT I have a combo in mind; In Quest Mage, complete Quest, play this and have 5 secrets now in hand. Next turn, drop 2 Mana Addicts, 1 Sorcerers Apprentice, then Quest. Get one more Sorcerers Apprentice out and spam all 5 Secrets, giving Mana Addicts +10 attack each. Attack face, and now your opponent has to deal with 5 mage secrets and would have taken 25 damage from both Mana Addicts and the 1st Sorcerers Apprentice you played. Also any more spells you cast will increase the damage by 4 for each one so it is possible to OTK too. Probably not consistent enough but if I get this I‚Äôll try it anyways.', 'Did you forget that spell hunter ran Barnes and Y‚Äôsharj even though it messed up the no Minion theme? This is only 1minion, it will be seen in spell hunter for sure', 'Oh, I agree, just I think in Mage it would be overkill as you‚Äôve already got the option of 2 Arcanologists ‚Äì which I think is probably better for consistency.

Dragon Priest would only need about two more good cards to be good again.', 'Not every class has secrets available to them, this seems to be a waste?', 'It‚Äôs because all the class legendaries for this set are either the chief scientist of the class, or the legendary spell named after the chief scientist. While it‚Äôd be cool to have a dinosaur or beast scientist, the illustration and name for this card would likely have to change so people would immediately recognize it as a scientist.

Beast tag!', 'If you‚Äôve played a Warrior deck with Forge of Souls in it, you‚Äôd know if you only have one weapon left in it, you‚Äôll draw that one weapon when you cast Forge of Souls. Just because the card says Draw 5 different Secrets does not mean you have to play five different secrets in your deck to draw anything. Additionally. Azure Drake was one of the best Control cards out there because it was a minion with good enough stats that also drew a card. This can easily draw two or three. The draw is specific only to Paladin, Hunter, Mage, and Rogue, but it will still probably be good enough in the same way Elven Minstral is good enough in Rogue.', 'Time to put this in my Secret Rogue! üòÄ Nice tool for Secret Hunter (as it generally lacks draw). It‚Äôll interfere with Rhok‚Äôdelar, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth swapping for a Cloaked Huntress, Stitched Tracker, maybe Gadgetzan Auctioneer build. As of now, Paladin doesn‚Äôt have a lot of card draw outside of Divine Favor, which is useless against aggro builds, so I can see this maybe putting Secret Paladin back on the spot. Secret Mage? That‚Äôs a bit of another story. Sure, Mages have ways to get free Secrets in their minions, but those minions are hardly ever played. Mages have plenty of card draw, so it‚Äôs unlikely to be needed when you have Aluneth, Arcane Intellect, etc. Also, remember the card Glacial Mysteries? Hm?', 'why no love for this card? seems quiet good and probably has future potential with addition of new secrets. its like azure drake stats with more draw potential', 'Given the way cards like Forge of Souls and Ice Fishing work, you‚Äôd draw as many cards as you can up to the number the card allows. Thus, if you only have one weapon in your deck and you play Forge of Souls, you‚Äôll draw that one weapon. You can try it out yourself just build a Warrior deck with Forge of Souls and a single weapon or a Shaman deck with Ice Fishing and a single Murloc. As such, if your mage deck only plays Explosive Runes and Counterspell or your Hunter deck only plays Explosive Trap, Freezing Trap, and Wondering Monster, you‚Äôll draw a copy of each without needing to play five different secrets.', 'Secret Hunter and Spell Hunter are two separate decks. Secret Hunter is basically Spell Hunter if it removed some of the lesser spells and No minion requirement spells for a midrange hunter core of minions.

Next rotation maybe?', 'Why is this not the Hunter Legendary? Like it seems way more on theme for Hunter than Boommaster Flark. Perhaps it was a last minute switcheroo because they have no new Hunter Secrets.', 'Well, there u got ur Drawmachine Hunters.', 'Not really. Just drawing one of each of Freezing Trap, Explosive Trap, and Wondering Monster should be enough. Plus, some are starting to include Rat Trap. Even when Cloaked Huntress was around, I don‚Äôt recall Secret Hunter playing more than four different Secrets', 'so only 2 cards(which are not as close as game winning as SS) out of 30 and its already a highroll,well i guess taunt druid is a highroll too then', 'Fastestest card to be nerfed in September', 'By your awful logic literally every single class card is 1/5 because they are solo class', 'Card will absolutely not see play in mage.

You have to figure 2 secrets is not very good you have to run at least 3 different secrets to find running this card beneficial.', 'You have to run 5 secrets in your deck and not draw them and then they don‚Äôt even come into play they just enter your hand. 1. The Minion is understated. 2. you risk overdrawing. 3. You still have to pay the mana cost of the secrets.

Zerek‚Äôs into Velen, Malygos, Radiant Elemental plus Mind Blast is 20 damage. Smite is 14 damage at 0 mana. Any spell damage minions add 4 damage, Bloodmage Thalos in particular as it is a good fit. And Radiant Elemental Into Zerek into Velen, Maly, and 2nd Radiant allows Mind Blast to be played for 0. This is the full combo but even pulling just a Velen or Malygos can end games. And although you can only play one copy of Zerek since its a spell Shadow Visions is gonna give Priest far more consistency than any of the other classes will be enjoying with their legendary spells.', 'neutral legendary!‚Ä¶.. that‚Äôs good in 1 class‚Ä¶.. and only even use able in 3‚Ä¶.. derp', 'Subject 9 is probably a step into making Secret Paladin viable again. It definitely isn‚Äôt Mysterious Challenger, but it does draw out most of the low value secrets out of your deck, making each of your later draws better. For Mage and Hunter, a five mana 4/4 draw two or three specific cards from your deck is perfectly playable. In those too, drawing a secret in the late game isn‚Äôt very good unless it is specifically Explosive Runes or Freezing Trap. Plus, the Beast tag isn‚Äôt irrelevant for Hunters. You could also play this in Rogue, but the Rogue secrets aren‚Äôt very good. As long as Secrets remain a popular option in Mage and Hunter, Subject 9 will see at least some play.

The problem OP has with this card (which is a valid complaint), is that it‚Äôs literally unusable in most classes and yet takes the place of a NEUTRAL legendary.

Meanwhile this card is NEVER going to be any better than a vanilla 5 mana 4/4 for all 6 classes that can‚Äôt get secrets. Your DK comment is completely idiotic, because the DK cards obviously don‚Äôt take up the spot of one of the neutral legendaries. Your Aya/Kazakus comment is also just dumb, because if you check the Gadgetzan list of legendaries, you‚Äôll see that each of the classes only had one legendary, because the second class legendary was Aya/Kazakus/Don Han‚ÄôCho, it was just in the neutral section so they didn‚Äôt have to put separate copies into each class that could use it.
